PURPOSE:
The purpose of the CityBot project is to enhance citizen access to government services by providing an AI-powered chatbot that simplifies complex bureaucratic processes, reduces service delays, and improves overall accessibility. CityBot aims to bridge the gap between citizens and government services by offering an efficient, user-friendly, and always-available digital assistant.

It offers a simple, conversational interface that requires no technical expertise.
Potential for Future Automation and Integration:

CityBot can be extended to connect with government databases and enable real-time transactions, such as license renewals and appointment scheduling.
Future enhancements may include voice interaction, predictive analytics, and AI-driven decision support.
